# Creative Applications of Machine Learning â€“  <br/> A Hands-On Workshop on the Web (for {Absolute} Beginners)

This is a repository with all the code and materials for the online dai workshop on 17 September 2020, 10am - 2pm. 

This workshops draws heavily on the friendly open source projects [ml5.js](https://ml5js.org/) and [p5.js](https://p5js.org/), which you should check out. 

A special and big shoutout to [Yining Shi](https://github.com/yining1023) who developed many of the materials provided here. The curriculum of this workshop was heavily inspired by Yining's introductiory course on [Bots and Machine Learning](https://schoolofma.org/bots) at the School of Machines in the summer of 2019 and her [Machine Learning for the Web's](https://github.com/yining1023/machine-learning-for-the-web) class at ITP in New York.

## Housekeping

We are collecting all links and non-code materials in our [Slack channel](https://join.slack.com/t/daicreativeml-ryp8974/shared_invite/zt-hddjfwo2-HZNMKyBPQw1TsiPkXV0_wQ). This way we can exchange materials and links on the fly with everybody.


## Topics
- What is machine learning (ML)?
- What are some of the core concepts in ML?
- What are common applications of ML?
- Why engage with creative applications of ML?
- What tools can we use in creative ML applications?

## Get started
To run each code example, open your terminal (HowTo: [Mac](https://www.idownloadblog.com/2019/04/19/ways-open-terminal-mac/) or [Windows](https://www.howtogeek.com/235101/10-ways-to-open-the-command-prompt-in-windows-10/#targetText=Open%20Command%20Prompt%20from%20the,open%20an%20administrator%20Command%20Prompt.)) and type in the following commands:
```
Clone this repository (folder)
$ git clone https://github.com/alsino/creative-applications-ml.git

Go to the folder you have just downloaded
$ cd creative-applications-ml

Go to the specific example folder we are working in, i.e. for the first imageClassification example:
$ cd 1-imageClassification

Start up a simple web server in the current directory (note: you will need to have python installed on your machine)
$ python -m SimpleHTTPServer     # $ python3 -m http.server (if you are using python 3)



```

## Install Python
In case you do not have python installed on your computer, here are the instructions for installation for both [Mac](https://realpython.com/installing-python/#macos-mac-os-x) and [Windows](https://realpython.com/installing-python/#windows).
